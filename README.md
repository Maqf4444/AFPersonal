## **ðŸ”¹ How to Run**
1. **Clone the repository** and navigate to the project directory:

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
   cd repository-name

2. **Ensure you have GCC and necessary libraries installed.** 

3. **Compile the server:**
- gcc -o gameserver gameserver.c -pthread

4. **Run the server, specifying a root directory:**
- ./gameserver .

5. **Place 2of12.txt in the root directory (available in the repository).**
6. **Access the game via localhost:8000 in a web browser.**
