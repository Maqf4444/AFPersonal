My Personal Projects Repository

Welcome to my GitHub repository! I'm new to GitHub and still in the process of adding both school and personal projects. This repository serves as a collection of various coding projects I've worked on, covering different aspects of programming and software development.

What Youâ€™ll Find Here

School Projects: Assignments and coursework from my academic studies.

Personal Projects: Independent projects where I explore programming concepts and experiment with new ideas.

Project Documentation: Each program includes a README explaining what it does and how to run it.

How to Use This Repository

Browse the directories to find projects of interest.

Each project has instructions on how to compile, run, or test it.

Feel free to provide feedback or suggestions!

I'm continuously updating this repository as I work on more projects, so stay tuned for more additions!
